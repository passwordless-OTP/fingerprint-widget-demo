## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Firebase account (optional when using mock mode)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sso-plus-shopify
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

3. Set up Firebase configuration
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Firebase configuration:

#### Option 1: Using Mock Firebase (for development)
```
# Firebase Configuration (can be empty when using mock)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=

# Use mock Firebase for development
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_FIREBASE=true
```

#### Option 2: Using Real Firebase
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id

# Set to false to use real Firebase
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_FIREBASE=false
```

4. Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Mock Firebase Service

For development and testing purposes, the application includes a mock Firebase service that simulates Firebase Authentication and Firestore functionality without requiring a real Firebase project.

### Features of Mock Firebase:

- **Phone Authentication**: Simulates OTP verification with a fixed code "1234"
- **User Management**: Creates and manages mock user accounts
- **Allow/Block Lists**: Includes pre-configured allow and block lists
- **User Activity Logging**: Tracks user actions with a configurable binary switch
- **No External Dependencies**: Works completely offline

### Using Mock Firebase:

1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_FIREBASE=true` in your `.env.local` file
2. Use the application as normal - all Firebase operations will be simulated
3. For testing, use "1234" as the OTP code
4. Pre-configured allowed numbers: "(555) 123-4567", "+1234567890", "+447911123456", "+919876543210"
5. Pre-configured blocked numbers: "(555) 999-9999", "+1999999999"
6. User activity logging is disabled by default but can be enabled for debugging and testing

### User Activity Logging

The mock Firebase implementation includes a user activity logging feature that can be enabled during development and testing:

```typescript
import { mockFirebase } from '../app/lib/mocks/firebase.mock';

// Enable logging
mockFirebase.userActivity.enableLogging();

// Get logs
const logs = mockFirebase.userActivity.getLogs();

// Filter logs by user, phone number, or action
const userLogs = mockFirebase.userActivity.getUserLogs('user123');
const phoneLogs = mockFirebase.userActivity.getPhoneNumberLogs('+1234567890');
const actionLogs = mockFirebase.userActivity.getActionLogs('login');

// Disable logging when done
mockFirebase.userActivity.disableLogging();
```

For more details, see the [User Activity Logging documentation](docs/UserActivityLogging.md).

For production deployment, make sure to:
1. Set up a real Firebase project with Phone Authentication enabled
2. Configure the environment variables with your Firebase credentials
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_FIREBASE=false`

## Admin Interface

The application includes a secure admin interface for managing the Allow/Block lists. The admin interface is protected by phone-based authentication:

1. Only authorized admin phone numbers can access the admin interface
2. Admin authentication uses the same OTP verification flow as regular users
3. The default admin phone number is +1-323-244-9265 (configurable in the code)

To access the admin interface:
1. Navigate to `/admin`
2. Enter the admin phone number
3. Verify with the OTP code
4. Manage Allow/Block lists through the admin dashboard

For security reasons, the admin interface should only be accessible to authorized personnel.

# Admin CLI for SSO+ Shopify Widget

A comprehensive command-line interface for managing and simulating various aspects of the SSO+ Shopify Widget, including device profiles, human behavior, and automation tools.

```bash
# For Bash or Zsh
source <(path/to/admin-cli.js --completion)

# For Fish (in ~/.config/fish/config.fish)
path/to/admin-cli.js --completion | source
```

After enabling auto-completion, you can use the Tab key to:
- Complete commands and subcommands
- View available options
- Complete option values (like device profiles, humanness levels, etc.)
